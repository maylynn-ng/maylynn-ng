#### :raising_hand_woman: I'm a full stack developer with a particular fancy for frontend. Most recently I've been enjoying playing with React Native and fuelling my addiction to emojis & animations :grimacing:

:balloon: currently working on this [project](https://github.com/maylynn-ng/beerb), and we have a [demo video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZ4gDSbOGk4&feature=youtu.be) if ya wanna check it out :v:

<br> 

Some technologies I've worked with are JavaScript, TypeScript, React, React Native, Redux, Node, Express, MongoDB, PostgreSQL etc etc.

I enjoy solving problems and trying out creative solutions to particularly fiddly ones. Something that fills my heart is making people smile and laugh, and I try to bring that into everything I do ðŸ¥°

While I love yoga, playing guitar and taking time to myself to relax, my mind is almost always looking for new challenges to undertake!
